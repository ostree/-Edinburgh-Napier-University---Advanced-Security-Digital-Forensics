Modules that you will study* as part of this course

Applied Cryptography and Trust ( CSN11131 )
The focus of this module is to provide a core understanding of the fundamental areas of cryptography, identity, and trust. A key feature is to cover both the theoretical areas, while often demonstrating practical applications including key protocols.

The module key areas are:
• Privacy, and Cryptography Fundamentals (Confidentiality, Sec Models, Cipher types)
• Asymmetric Key Encryption. Including RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
• Symmetric Key Encryption. Including AES and associated modes.
• Hashing and MAC Methods. Including MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-3 and PBKDF2.
• Security Protocols: HTTPS, SSL/TLS, DNSSec, IPSec, WPA
• Key Exchange. Diffie-Hellman Method, ECDH.
• Trust Infrastructures. Digital Certificates, Signatures, Key Distribution Centres (Kerberos), OAuth
• Identity and Authentication (Passwords, Authentication tokens, Key pair identity, Multi-factor, Biometric Authentication).
• Distributed Systems: Blockchain, Distributed Ledgers and Cryptocurrency. Smart Contracts, Data Tokenization, and Transactions.
• Future Cryptography: Zero Knowledge Proof, Homomorphic Encryption, Light-weight cryptography, and Quantum robust methods.
• Host and Domains: Trust systems. Authentication with Active Directory Authorisation: Log integration and rights.

Computer Penetration Testing ( CSN11127 )
This module will cover a range of elements concerned with digital penetration testing and security testing. Initial lectures consider important soft skills such as documentation techniques, reporting, the law, and risk assessment and management. The practical skills and their related theoretical knowledge include operating system weaknesses, information gathering (both passive and active), and various ethical hacking techniques and processes. Considerable practical focus is made on available tools to assist in auditing and penetration testing. Aspects targeted include operating systems, common network services, and network-based applications.
